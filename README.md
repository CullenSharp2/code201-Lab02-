# For Lab 2
For Lab 02, we created a new repo and created a new page, About Me. I added a heading which I styled, and about me header with separate styling, and four blocks of paragraph text. I then created a bio and added a series of true or false prompts about me. The user answers, then I return an alert to them indicating a true or false answer. 

# For Lab 3
We are adding onto our existing pages using loops and arrays.
