        <h1>Skyler Johnson's Bio Page!</h1>
        <br />
        My name is Skyler Johnson, I am 37 years of age, and I live in Spokane, WA. I was born in Billings, MT and grew up in Eugene, OR. I attended the University of Oregon to study music performance. I then went on to obtain a Master's degree in music performance from DePaul University in Chicago, IL where I lived for eight years. 
        <br />
        I ended up moving to Spokane, WA in 2015 when I won the audition for bass trombone in the Spokane Symphony Orchestra. I am currently still a member of the orchestra and I teach part-time at Whitworth University. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I have performed with many orchestras including the Grant Park Symphony, Milwaukee Symphony, Jacksonville Symphony, Oregon Symphony, and the Lyric Opera of Chicago. I have been a member of multiple orchestra including the Quad City Symphony, Dubuque Symphony, and Battle Creek Symphony. I have taught at multiple different universites including St. Xavier University, University of Idaho, and Eastern Washington University.
        <br />
        The pandemic has devastated the performing arts industry and will take a long time to recover. I am taking my skills and tool I learned as a musician and applying them to my new journey, becoming a software developer. My goal is to work hard in this field and do my best.
